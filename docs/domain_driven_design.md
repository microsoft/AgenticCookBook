# Domain Driven Design and Agents

## What is Domain Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software design approach that emphasizes the importance of understanding the business domain in which a software system operates. 

The approach is useful in complex domains where the shared model and understanding adds significant clarity and helps in formulating a common understanding of the domain.

## Designing multi-agent systems using Domain Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) fosters a collaborative environment where domain experts and system designers come together to create a common language. This shared language is essential for translating business objectives into technical specifications. DDD employs bounded contexts to simplify complex mappings, with each context possessing its own domain model.

In multi-agent systems, each agent operates within its own distinct context, mirroring the bounded contexts of DDD. By applying DDD principles, multi-agent systems can be designed to ensure that each agent’s actions are aligned with overarching business goals. This approach not only streamlines the design process but also ensures that the agents collectively contribute to the business’s strategic objectives.
