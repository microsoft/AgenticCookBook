# What is AutoGen?

AutoGen is a multi-agent conversation framework.

AutoGen enables you to:

- Build applications based on multi-agent conversations.
- Compose and orchestrate complex workflows using a diverse set of conversation patterns. 

## What is an agent?

An agent refers to a system designed to achieve specific objectives for a user.

Agents can have varying degrees of autonomy when accomplishing goals. 

To effectively carry out its functions, an agent may use a range of tools, including AI models, knowledge bases, and software, which assist in data processing, executing actions, and successfully accomplishing the intended tasks.

## What are multi-agent systems?

Multi-agent systems consist of multiple specialized agents that work together to achieve a common objective. These systems are well-suited for complex tasks that require collaboration and coordination.

Consider the task of planning a winter vacation to a warm destination. This involves several steps:

1. Researching online for potential travel spots.
1. Checking personal and, if applicable, others' availability by consulting calendars.
1. Reviewing bank accounts to determine a travel budget based on the planned dates.
1. Utilizing travel tools to find the best deals on flights and hotels, while considering reward programs and more affordable travel periods.
1. Conducting further online research for activities at each potential location.
1. Synthesizing all gathered information—availability, expenses, and activities—to make an informed decision.
1. Proceeding with the actual bookings of flights, hotels, and reservations.

This process requires extensive information gathering, planning, and execution.

Creating an application to handle this as a single agent could be challenging due to the varied contexts and domains involved.

On the other hand, designing it as a multi-agent system simplifies the problem. Each agent can focus on a specific aspect of the task - managing calendars, booking travel, conducting web searches, handling finances - allowing the collective effort to be more efficient and effective in achieving the goal.
